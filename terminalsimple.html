  As was tradition Queen Maya, when her baby was almost due,<br>
  departed Kapilvastu for her father's kingdom, in order to have the child in<br>
  her father's house. Along the way, the procession stopped in Lumbini Garden<br>
  to rest. Beneath a sala tree, the birth began unexpectedly. The child<br>
  walked seven steps, and at each step appeared a lotus flower. On the seventh<br>
  step he stopped, pointed up, and declared:<br><br>
  "I am chief of the world.<br>
  Eldest am I in the world.<br>
  Foremost am I in the world.<br>
  This is the last birth.<br>
  There is now no more coming to be."<br><br>
  Several things happened after this. The queen was taken back to Kapilvastu,<br>
  where she died. 2500 years later, many people built temples on the spot.<br>
